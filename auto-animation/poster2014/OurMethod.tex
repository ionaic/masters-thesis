To achieve takeoff, we use a simplified muscle model to compute target poses for several stages of the jump.  These poses then become the basis for the character animation, which the controller attempts to match using a PD control to change its positions.  A pose is computed by determining the desired angle and force of takeoff.  The upper body is treated as rigid, with the angle of the torso affecting the shifting of weight.  Arms are ignored as their effects can be modeled with the position of the torso.

We use a simplified muscle model to avoid the extra complexity introduced by a full muscle-based controller.  A muscle based controller requires modeling of the inter-muscular relations as well as the musculo-skeletal interactions, which introduces instability as well as complexity to the system.  We believe that visually plausible results may be achieved with a simpler model, using the muscle model to compute target poses.
