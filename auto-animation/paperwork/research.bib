Abstract = {Human body is a complex life forms.A lot of complexity means that affect motor function of factor structure. Human movement is a dynamic feedback process control, need to be coordinated through the visual, vestibular, proprioceptive feedback, not only by the physical laws of gravity, inertia force of domination, but also by the emotional impact of individual factors such as hobbies. Computer modeling of human actions including key frame method, kinematics, dynamics, motion capture method and process control methods. These methods have their own advantages, there are also their limitations. The different methods to combine the use of their complementary strengths will be the focus of future research and development direction. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Significant differences were found between the two age groups for most motions. The data were compared with estimations in the handbook of The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons as the standard reference. The data constitute a more detailed set of measurements, based on a sample described according to height and age, than has been available hitherto.},
