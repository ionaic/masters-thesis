\specialhead{ACKNOWLEDGMENT}
I would like to thank Rosa Tung and Jim McCarthy for acting as consultants for existing artistic methods as well as usage of tools which allowed me to produce the mesh and rig used in this thesis and showed me an artist's view of animation.  I would like to thank Jon Holman for discussing the mathematics of optimization problems with me, which helped to direct my choice for how to solve the problems.  Finally, thanks to my parents for their support and help with proofreading as well as sanity-checking my math.
